 Death of a sun-like star (Director's Cut)
0=========================================0

85%$ of stars have a binary star (Sister Star)
	-Usually born very close in time 
	-As a resault one is usualy a white dwarf when the other is a giant

The White dwarf(WD) pulls fuel from its binary star 
	-when WD reaches 1.4 solar masses, they attempt to reignite fusion
	-Gravity Compacts the star into a WD
	-Because the WD is so dense, the energy generated by fusion gets trapped in the star
		-the energy eventualy ruptures the star, causing a thermonuclear explosion (type: 1A SuperNova)
