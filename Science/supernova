	SuperNovas
	|	 |
+-------+--------+---------------------------+
Type 1a supernova			     |
-white dwarf supervova releases alot of iron |
-Rocky planes + life			     |
					     |
Type 2a supernova                            |
-explosion of massive core (1.5-2.9 m0       +----------------------------------+
-create occurrs when star uses iron as fuel					|
-fusing is when an element becomes a new one					|
-wen it starts using iron as fuel it explodes					|
-Creates ellements heaver than iron						|
										|
Type 2b super nova aka (COLLAPSAR OR HIPERNOVA):				|
-occurs in hypermassave stars							|
-there core = 3.0 ->								|
-follows the same stage as a 2a supernova until the core collapses		|
-when the core collapses the gravity crishes  the core beound perfect dencity	|
 creating a singularity								|
-this is the birth of a black hole						|
-back hole begins consuming the star						|
-energy builds up at the accretion disk						|
-acrretion disk - material which builds						|
 an orbithing disk around amassibe object					|
-energy build up in two massive beams						|
 of gamma tayes called gamma reay burstor or "GRB"				|
-the avarage energy releaced is around 100x GRB
										|
										|
secounds 0:									|
-the shock wave comeing from the core collides with the shells of gas which     |
 are falling into the core							|
-collition creates masss fusion event creating all elements heavier than iron	|
