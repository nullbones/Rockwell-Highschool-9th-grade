		What is your favorite thing to do in the snow?

Well i dont really like to play in the snow now that i am older but when i 
was younger i used to make snow forts and snowmans but mostly snow forts.
also i used to make huge snowballs and roll around on them and roll them down
hills and such not also i used to sled (actualy i think that was my favorite)
and i still sled now but i just dont make snow stuff anymore.
