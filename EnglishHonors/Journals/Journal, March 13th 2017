Question: What is something that you fell qualified to teach someone else

Well I feel that everyone is qualified to teach anything because if you can 
do it than you can teach it also i think that the world should be less if your
qualified and more just giving what you know expanding someone elses knowloage 
also if one person is teaching a subject than thats tough but if multiple
people are thats different because its less work for one person.
