Question: Describe the time you laughed the hardest

Well the time i laughed the hardest it felt like i could not breathe
like i was a fish out of water gasping for air but every time i would
i would let out a sudden burst of air following with a giggle. Over
and over again i would repeat thinking i cant breathe also thinking 
how amuseing it was. then once i stoped i would gasp for air and then
let out a calm sigh...
