Question: Who was your First Crush?

Well i dont think im going to answer that question. Thats a pretty
personal question also i dont feel like its very school appropriate.
Instead ill tell you about my week, On friday i went gome and cleaned
the house all day and wached my baby sister and then on saturday
i went to cyber sheild, there i became freinds with Cris. Cris
is a cool guy he is from the uk and he has been hacking sense he
was 8 years old "I know crazy right!" so he came over and had dinner
and he tought me some cool stuff like getting me some old linux distros
COS unix, etc. it was a good day you know now i have his number and i can
get ahold of him whenever i need it.
