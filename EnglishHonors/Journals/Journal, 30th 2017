Question: What do you think about newspapers

I think that news papers are great but i think that the fact
that you get paid by the amount of people who read it 
is wrong i think it should be more of a thing wear you pay for 
a subscription and you pay monthly because the news is not 
story time its also not an action movie so i think people
just want a good story to read. Also i think that
things like buzz feed and think mojo are just there
to make up and report on crazy things so they get views 
on youtube and get paid alot of money also they have
caused issues with the pesidental election 
which even was established during a spetch
that president donald trump gave.
