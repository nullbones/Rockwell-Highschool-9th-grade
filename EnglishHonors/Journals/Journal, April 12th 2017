Question: What is your favorite thing to do in spring time?

Well in the spring i love to go for canyon rides in our jeep
it makes me happy and feel at peace when we drive, also i love
to fly kites. I know kites are old and no one really does any
more but i love to. also i love to fly my drone and go to defcon
because defcon is around this time. also i love to just go 
outside but the older i get the more it seems i like to do the
opposite.
