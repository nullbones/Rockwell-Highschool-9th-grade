Question: Snowboarding or Skiing? Why?

well i personaly have never snowboarded or skiied. Ive sled!
thats always fun, if i had to pick one to do i would pick snowboarding
because when i rollerblade i always end up spreading my legs apart
and i can stop but when skiiing i dont thing i can stop that easy. 
but if i was to snowboard i would not end up being a t shape
