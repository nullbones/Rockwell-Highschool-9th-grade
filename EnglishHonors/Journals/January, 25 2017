They say everyone gets 15 minutes of fame
what do you want your 15 minutes to be?

Well thats a hard question really. i dont know what my 
15 minutes of fame will be, nor do i want or know what 
my 15 minutes of fame will be. i just enjoy doing cyber
security and want to do that for a living thats really it.
also i kinda want my 15 minutes of fame to be something 
that changed the way something worked. that would be cool
