Question: What do you Think Of this Photo?

Well when i look at it i think of utah, Because the mountains enclose the
valley and leave smoag also i think of deppression because you kinda fall
into a hole when your depressed and it seems like you cant get out but you 
can and its prettyer that it seems. Also today is my birthday and im so happy
about it! i Turned 15 Years old and i can start my drivers test if i want
but im also scared to death of driving because i dont want to kill anyone.
