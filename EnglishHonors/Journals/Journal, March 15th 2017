Question: Whats The most heroic Thing you've Personaly Witnessed

Well i remember that this one time at the park this kid got hurt and his big brother carryed
him from the park like two miles to his house and that was pretty heroic and beautyful
also dave, Eastons dad was a firefighter. he's retired now but he went into a burning building
and saved a baby from burning. There's alot more heroic moments that i can talk about
but im way to tired today and as i type this i have to listen to music to stay awake because of how tired 
i am at the moment also i really only got a few hours of sleep because our dinner did not get to our house 
until 10:00 PM which sucked but it still got there also last night i watched rouge1 with my dad and brother
is was really good im kinda upset how they died, (Sorry for the spoiler) but they died dilivering the plans
of the deathstar... but other than that it was a wonderful movie.
