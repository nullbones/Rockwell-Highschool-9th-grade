Question: What did i do this morning

Well first i woke up at 5:00am and shutoff my alarm then i got up put some sweatpants and a t-shirt on.
then i grabbed the leash and put it on my dog and then i walked down the first stairs then i said goodmorning to my 
little brother who could berily keep his eyes open. then i walked down the second stairs and opened the back door and
walked out with murphy. after he was done doing his buissness then i walked back inside and closed the door then i
ran up the second flight of stairs and grabed the food scoup and got a full scoup and ran back down stairs and put it
in murphys dog dish then i grabed his watter bowl and ran to the bathroom and filled it with water from the sink and
then i ran back and put the water next to his food. now while he was eating his breakfest i ran upstairs and got my
breakfeast, i went to the pantry and grabed the bag of captin crunch and set it on the counter then i opened the 
fridge and grabed the gallon of milk and set that on the counter then i grabbed a bowl and a spoon and poured the 
cereal into the bowl and poured the milk in with it and ate my food then i showered and while i was doing this murphy 
just followed me and hung out. then i got dressed packed my bag and left to the bus stop.
