What Is Love?
To me mr winterton love it teamwork and building each other up. Building and growing
as a team, Love to me is not just a status or a word its a state of mind.. a meaning
when you love someone to me you dont just say that i love you, you show it as in mabie
holding a door. its like climbing up a crack in the canyon you know in the movies
where two people lock arms together and together take one step up and pull each other
up then take a second step together and pull each other up. its in sync thats what love
is to me a compation, your growing together your a team.
